## COVID Containment & Economic Recovery


1. Exit Polls show primary economic concern (mitigated by partisan-filtered perception of 
econ) (correlation between economic concern surveys & popvote & policy views of Trump / 
Biden)

2. Partial Economic recovery (Q1 & Q3 support "V" shaped recovery theory, mitigated by 
merits of alternative "K" shaped recovery theory (not a *full*, many still hurting))


Fundamentals and polls alike got a lot of flack this election cycle. With COVID-19
and economic lockdowns in many parts of the country, forecasters who relied on
Q2 GDP growth for their models were met with an unprecedented 8% *drop*, leading
to unreasonable predictions of 20-30% for Trump's vote share. Poll aggregating
sites told a similar story, with Biden up 5-8% in many key battleground states
like Michigan, Maine, and Pennsylvania.

And then Trump outperformed those polls by around 3% ***across the board***.

I think two main questions arose after Election Day:

1. **Why did Trump outperform the polls?**
2. **Could fundamentals still have had predictive power this election?**

One media narrative proposes a partial answer to both: [Fears about the economy under COVID-19 lockdowns helped Trump outperform polls](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/04/exit-polls-economy-covid-lockdown-trump). This narrative proposes that voters had become discontented with an intense,
exhaustive pandemic response, and saw Biden as supporting its continuation and
Trump supporting its cessation. This dichotomy between rebuilding the economy
and curbing coronavirus spread, combined with partial economic recovery in the
months preceding the election, may have led people to vote for Trump at
higher rates than predicted.

I think testing this narrative is important because for an election cycle as
tumultuous as this one, with as many predictive red herrings as this one, what
stays the same can be very telling of how people actually vote. To that end, I
have looked at COVID case data, GDP data, poll aggregator data, and exit polling
data to test 2 (presumably) plausible implications of this narrative:

1. If people preferred Trump's policy response to the pandemic, then there should
be a negative correlation between new cases and average support in polls.
2. If the economic recovery played a role in Trump's overperformance, then
including it in a polling regression should increase its accuracy relative to
a polls-only model.
