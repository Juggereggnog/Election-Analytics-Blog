#### Past Presidential Election Results: A Prelude to Prediction


We begin with past presidential election results to try to understand historical
voting trends at a holistic level. Looking at elections from 1948 to 2012, we
can see a couple of immediate trends.

- *No state is immune to change.* Whether it is due to various migration
movements, ideological shifts, booming or busting economies, all states have
voted for both parties over this 68-year history. That said,
- *Change is slowing down.* It behooves the nation as a whole to have an open
mind about competing policies, but the data show that many states are ossifying,
generally finding a preference for Democrats on coastal states and Republicans
in the South and Midwest. This is the marker of modern elections: the "settling"
of the political landscape.


And so the natural question that arises is which states are still capable of
changing their mind? Where are the swing states, and what does that even mean?



##### Swing States


So what exactly are "swing states"?

Looking at the first graph, we would expect according to the common definition
that swing states would have an absolute win margin near 0. There is a healthy
mix of Democrats and Republicans, which cancel each other out at the polls.
