## The Economy: The Litmus Test of the Retrospective Voter


While the economy is often hailed in election analytics as one of the most
powerful variables in predicting voting behavior, it is almost equally vague as
a descriptive tool. Indeed, national economic data is the aggregation of
hundreds of millions of economic choices, made by individuals, firms, and
governments alike. Not only that, but it is also unclear what aspects of
the economy voters look to when making their decision: is it their own welfare,
or society's? Is it bird's-eye, aggregate data and reports, or an intuitive
gauge of the world around them?
