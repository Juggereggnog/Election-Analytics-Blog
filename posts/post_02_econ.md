## The Economy: The Litmus Test of the Retrospective Voter


While the economy is often hailed in election analytics as one of the most
powerful variables in predicting voting behavior, it is almost equally vague as
a descriptive tool. Indeed, national economic data is the aggregation of
hundreds of millions of economic choices, made by individuals, firms, and
governments alike. Not only that, but it is also unclear what aspects of
the economy voters look to when making their decision: is it their own welfare,
or society's? Is it bird's-eye, aggregate data and reports, or an intuitive
gauge of the world around them?



## Local Unemployment


I will make the assumption for the following analysis that voters follow from
partial economic information, and are slightly sociotropic, meaning that they
most likely place emphasis on themselves and their surrounding communities.
This informed my decision in using state (representing local) unemployment data
in quarters 2 and 3 (representing partial) of election years from 1976 onward.
Additionally, I looked at the _relative_ change in unemployment between quarters
as people are more likely to view changes over holistic levels.

## Prediction


Following from the increased predictive power of the local data, I plugged in
the delta unemployment change from Q1 to Q2 (as Q3 data is currently not yet
available) into the regression and "predict" that Donald Trump will win 21.2% of
the popular vote.



(Mention Achen Bartels where they talk about voters' ability to correctly
attribute changes in welfare with the appropriate party when talking about covid 19)
(how time and locality affect predictive power of economy)

Voters: partial, local (slightly sociotropic), direct
